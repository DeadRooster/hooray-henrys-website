</audio><p>Groovy for the HH.</p><h2>Comments</h2><blockquote><p>What a really fucking good guitar riff! Good job guys! I want to hear more and more HH songs!!! — guiguilele, Hooray's addict, September 9th 2005 PS: any tour dates?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>…We were rehearsing for the upcoming tour at that time. Before joining the others in the studio, Ron and I usually had a walk downtown and we often dropped into small clubs to hear “what the new sound gives” as French people say… I love French people, but they often come into cheesy crap. You can’t treat them serious actually. I mean… Have you read Rousseau? That’s a shame, you’ve missed one of the funniest time you can imagine. This man is a joke…. Anyway, Ron and I had just ordered our supposed last whiskeys when we saw a small rusty wizard jump onto his drums and a strong squared-shoulder boy grab his guitar and both start rocking hard. That was oh damn riffin’, I can tell you! Like the Devil himself was stroking their hands and fingers… We dropped our glasses and kept our mouths shut for the rest of the gig. Just listening… We were attending the Devil’s funerals. Every single naughty angel had decided to celebrate Chaos’ birthday his own way, and I was invited! Was the world collapsing? No, I was… They just blew us… I don’t really remember what they sounded like, but I know it was all about making people jump around and watch angels dance on top of the drums… I hope we could still rock like that… I hope we already have !… Maybe thirty years ago, or maybe never… By the way, have you listened to “A Bigger Bang”?… Sucks, doesn’t it ? I know, it’s all Mick. Except “Rough Justice” and “Back of my Han“… These are “Exile” leftovers, it’s Mick Taylor on both. But don’t say it loud, Ron has been trying to kick alcohol away really hard… — K. Richards, September 9th 2005"</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Great song! Just Great! So simple and hear-beating, I love it. Makes ne wanna ouh ouh ouh… Love — K.O., September 9th 2005</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>WooooooooooH Girl, I love this song Wooo wooo wooo We won't lose control!!! Well done les gars — Lulu, September 16th 2005</p></blockquote>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://your-website-url.com/posts/printemps-de-bourges-2006</guid><title>Printemps de Bourges 2006</title><description>Printemps de Bourges 2006</description><link>https://your-website-url.com/posts/printemps-de-bourges-2006</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Aug 2005 23:02:00 +0200</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Printemps de Bourges 2006</h1><p>Hooray Henrys announce that they will take part of the "Attention talent scene" operation.

Maybe you want to know the real story about how the band was created. Let me explain this fairy tale, as I like to call it. Once upon a time, when I still was a young blond boy, I create the Hooray Henrys (Dirty was the dirty one, Groovy was the groovy one). Yeah, the Hooray Henrys were a concept of mine. I have barely forgotten these childhood companions. But at the 24th June of 2001, a too-long-to-explain event makes me remember this fabulous imaginary friends. During more than a year, I cast musicians and singers all around the world, in order to find the best elements I could not even expect in my most beautiful dreams. 365 days later, I was totally disappointed because I still do not find what I was looking for. As I was so tired, I finally took two poor guys in a backstreet of Bordeaux. I bought them pants and rock'n'roll shoes. And that was how the Hooray Henrys story began. Now, they have grown, they are better than ever and I'm really proud to be their manager ! — Guiguilele, the manager, April 26th 2005</p></blockquote>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://your-website-url.com/posts/the-blog-opens-hooray</guid><title>The blog opens !

I am a little bit disapointed, if you get it. I am your very first fan and, above all, your very first singer and I hope we will be able to soon listen to your own music ! — Coke, April 20th 2005</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Thanks for your comment Coke.
