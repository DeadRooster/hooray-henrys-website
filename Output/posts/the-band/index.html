Maybe you want to know the real story about how the band was created. Let me explain this fairy tale, as I like to call it. Once upon a time, when I still was a young blond boy, I create the Hooray Henrys (Dirty was the dirty one, Groovy was the groovy one). Yeah, the Hooray Henrys were a concept of mine. I have barely forgotten these childhood companions. But at the 24th June of 2001, a too-long-to-explain event makes me remember this fabulous imaginary friends. During more than a year, I cast musicians and singers all around the world, in order to find the best elements I could not even expect in my most beautiful dreams. 365 days later, I was totally disappointed because I still do not find what I was looking for. As I was so tired, I finally took two poor guys in a backstreet of Bordeaux. I bought them pants and rock'n'roll shoes. And that was how the Hooray Henrys story began. Now, they have grown, they are better than ever and I'm really proud to be their manager ! — Guiguilele, the manager, April 26th 2005</p></blockquote></div><span>Tagged with: </span><ul class="tag-list"><li><a href="/tags/hooray-henrys">Hooray Henrys</a></li></ul></article></div><footer><p>Generated using <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish">Publish</a></p><p><a href="/feed.rss">RSS feed</a></p></footer></body></html>
