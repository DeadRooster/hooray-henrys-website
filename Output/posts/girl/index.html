</audio><p>Groovy for the HH.</p><h2>Comments</h2><blockquote><p>What a really fucking good guitar riff! Good job guys! I want to hear more and more HH songs!!! — guiguilele, Hooray's addict, September 9th 2005 PS: any tour dates?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>…We were rehearsing for the upcoming tour at that time. Before joining the others in the studio, Ron and I usually had a walk downtown and we often dropped into small clubs to hear “what the new sound gives” as French people say… I love French people, but they often come into cheesy crap. You can’t treat them serious actually. I mean… Have you read Rousseau? That’s a shame, you’ve missed one of the funniest time you can imagine. This man is a joke…. Anyway, Ron and I had just ordered our supposed last whiskeys when we saw a small rusty wizard jump onto his drums and a strong squared-shoulder boy grab his guitar and both start rocking hard. That was oh damn riffin’, I can tell you! Like the Devil himself was stroking their hands and fingers… We dropped our glasses and kept our mouths shut for the rest of the gig. Just listening… We were attending the Devil’s funerals. Every single naughty angel had decided to celebrate Chaos’ birthday his own way, and I was invited! Was the world collapsing? No, I was… They just blew us… I don’t really remember what they sounded like, but I know it was all about making people jump around and watch angels dance on top of the drums… I hope we could still rock like that… I hope we already have !… Maybe thirty years ago, or maybe never… By the way, have you listened to “A Bigger Bang”?… Sucks, doesn’t it ? I know, it’s all Mick. Except “Rough Justice” and “Back of my Han“… These are “Exile” leftovers, it’s Mick Taylor on both. But don’t say it loud, Ron has been trying to kick alcohol away really hard… — K. Richards, September 9th 2005"</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Great song! Just Great! So simple and hear-beating, I love it. Makes ne wanna ouh ouh ouh… Love — K.O., September 9th 2005</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>WooooooooooH Girl, I love this song Wooo wooo wooo We won't lose control!!! Well done les gars — Lulu, September 16th 2005</p></blockquote></div><span>Tagged with: </span><ul class="tag-list"><li><a href="/tags/hooray-henrys">Hooray Henrys</a></li></ul></article></div><footer><p>Generated using <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish">Publish</a></p><p><a href="/feed.rss">RSS feed</a></p></footer></body></html>
