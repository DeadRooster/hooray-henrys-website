# Helicopter Cover

Another new song from the HH… It's a surf garage version of the Bloc Party's song _Helicopter_. The first who asks if the girls back-singing are still living by their parents will be hardly kicked in the ass!

You can listen it here:

This song is our cover for the V2 contest. As said by "Your Friends" : "If we won, I would eat one of my bollocks!". But nothing is lost with the help of the Gods of Rock'n Roll (Saint Elvis pray for us…).
