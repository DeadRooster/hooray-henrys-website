# The plan works

Ha ha! Just as we had planned it, we have been kicked out of the 2006 CQFD contest by Les Inrocks. Hmmm, silly people, the plan is just working as we were expecting it to do. The Hooray Henrys' wave is coming fellows! Be prepared for HH's 2006 year we have chosen to call "The Gigs Year".
